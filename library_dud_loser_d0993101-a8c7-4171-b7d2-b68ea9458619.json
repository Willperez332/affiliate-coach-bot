    "transcript": "They don't want you to know how to quiet your sugar cravings. They will tell you it's a willpower issue and get you on that shot before they ever mention what this Steve Irwin looking ass brain doctor said about your sugar cravings. What's interesting is that when you sleep deprive people or even just limit them to maybe just like five to six hours of sleep for a week, levels of leptin, which say you're full, don't eat more, they drop down. Levels of ghrelin that ramp up your hunger and say, I just ate a big meal but I'm not satisfied. I want to eat more. That hormone skyrockets when you're under slept. It's not just that you want to eat more; it's the things that you want to eat more of are the things that are more obesogenic. So these are more carbohydrate-rich foods, simple sugary foods, ice cream, sweets, etcetera. And also they found an increase in your preference for eating salty snacks. He literally just gave us the cheat code to looking and feeling better naturally. And I know it works because when I was a full-blown sugar gremlin, like I needed a sweet treat after every single meal just to have enough energy to get through the day. I had no jawline, constant under-eye bags, and all these random breakouts on my forehead from eating so much sugar. My ex would catch me at 11 p.m. rummaging through the cabinets like a freaking raccoon. He'd be like, babe, just go to sleep; you're not hungry. I thought he was just kind of being a jerk per usual, but he was actually writing his research thesis on this exact topic about how missing even one to two hours of quality sleep really messes with your hunger cues and hormones. So honestly, I kind of owe him a thank you because he's the one that put me onto Stella, which is a natural supplement that helps me fall asleep faster, stay asleep. It's not like those over-the-counter sleep aids; like it's not just knocking me out. It actually has ingredients to lower my stress levels. It calms my mind and reduces my cravings. There are ingredients in this blend that have been shown to reduce stress cravings and boost your mood. So it's like a win-win. If you're trying to look and feel your best, it really starts with a good night's sleep. But they're not going to tell you that, so girl to girl, I will. Go run and check out all the five-star reviews because the insomniacs are obsessed with this stuff. Just make sure you're adding Stella to your nightstand while it's still on sale.",

    "pacing_energy": "The video starts with a fast pace and high energy, capturing the viewer's attention with a controversial statement and a slightly aggressive tone.  The pace slows during the explanation of the scientific concepts, then picks up again with the personal anecdote and product promotion. The energy remains consistently high throughout, with a mix of humor and relatability."

  "core_lesson": "This video demonstrates that while a combination of a provocative hook and a relatable personal story can garner views, the lack of a strong call to action and insufficient emphasis on product benefits results in low conversions, highlighting the crucial need to align compelling content with effective sales strategies."
