    "transcript": "Did you know you can heal cavities? So my dad's been a dentist for the last 25 years and he says this is the craziest thing he's ever experienced. So this kid comes in and his teeth are absolutely awful. Cavities absolutely everywhere, terrible oral hygiene. He said this was literally one of the worst cases he's ever seen. So he just knew this kid was gonna have to get a lot of work done. So the parents of the kid asked my dad, yo, is there anything at all we can do in the meantime? Cause they just knew the bill was about to be ridiculous. My dad obviously being honest with them told them, yo guys, at this point there's honestly not much you can do. Obviously make sure he's flossing and brushing two to three times a day minimum. My dad obviously felt bad because he could tell that the parents were like determined to find a different solution. But he just couldn't think that anything was gonna work. Fast forward three months later and the kid comes back for a follow up appointment. Obviously my dad is just expecting, you know, the worst. But when he looked in his mouth, I am telling you he could not believe this was the same kid. His actual cavities were starting to get better and before his teeth were super yellow, now they were honestly much wider from what he said and not nearly as much plaque overall. Just much better hygiene and just an overall better situation. He obviously didn't have to do nearly as much work as he thought. So obviously out of curiosity my dad has to ask what did you guys do because this is not normal. Apparently the parents like they said went down this deep rabbit hole trying to figure out what they can do to reverse all the bad things that were happening with their kids teeth. They started learning about ingredients like xylitol, hydroxyapatite and looking into different gum bases like Mastic, chicle, and spruce. And basically just kept digging into what these super interesting NASA developed compounds do and their benefits they were just researching in depth to anything that could potentially help their kid. Then by random chance they come across this product which is a chewing gum that has every single one of those compounds and minerals that they were looking for and reading about. Not to mention it was super affordable. So they just had their kid basically chew it every single day, three times a day leading up to the appointment. And according to them that was the only thing that they did differently besides just brushing. So obviously my dad super skeptical asked them for a link to the product. I actually have it right here. It's called Underbrush Remineralizing Chewing Gum. It looks a little interesting, it's like this little brown cube. So I just started chewing it just out of pure curiosity based on that crazy transformation that kid had. But I gotta say this stuff works. I mean plus the nanohydroxyapatite which has been shown to remineralize teeth and a bunch of other natural non-synthetic ingredients. So if you're struggling with any of this health issues and wanna try something that actually works, I highly highly recommend giving this stuff a shot. The only problem and the only complaint I have about these things is that because they're such a good product they're literally never in stock. But I'm still gonna try to link it for you guys. If you see an orange car right here that means that they're not sold out yet. But if you don't that means that they are sold out. So just save the video and come back to it and just keep checking until they're back in stock. Just click the orange car right here and thank me later.",
