    "transcript": "Listen carefully...This motherfucker just slipped up on live television and got this episode banned off of the internet. Watch this before they take it down. Wait for it... I would wake up in the middle of the night like gasping for breath. Like I would wake up like whoa. So I did like a sleep study and they said that I have sleep apnea. And they said I stopped breathing 15 times an hour. So they gave me this machine that's called a CPAP machine. Oh yeah, I know that. Have you ever used that? Yeah, I have, yeah. It's a terrible invention honestly, and this is not a joke of any kind. The doctor said if you wear this, you know, we'll extend your life by probably by like three years. And I said, you know what, after wearing it for a month, I said I'm okay dying three years early. Now pay attention because is that not the same exact thing that Steve Harvey was trying to tell us? This is crazy. Sadly, you know, not too many people focus on the cure. It's more about treatment than anything. But I had sleep apnea waking up not breathing two, three times a night. They gave me a CPAP machine. I started sleeping on a CPAP machine. Oh, I hated it. It was just horrible. Because of this, I'm off CPAP. I don't sleep with that. I'm rested, I'm sharper, my mental focus has come back. So he was talking about his issues with mouth breathing and chronic snoring. And these issues were the root cause of his massive gut and all of his other health shit. And he said that the only thing that actually helped him out were natural remedies. Now I know Steve isn't the most qualified person to be talking about this stuff, but there was actually a product that went on Shark Tank that proves everything that he was saying. Listen to this. Tropical Rush is our best seller. There's a base of menthol and peppermint in all of them. Woo woo woo. There you go. That's really good. It's really quite a hit. It enhances your breathing for sure. Opens you up. Hang on a second. This is what they were sniffing in that video. It's called the Boom Boom Stick. There's only two all-natural ingredients in here, which are menthol and essential oils. The menthol will help clear out your nasal passages and then the essential oils will keep them open all day long, allowing you to actually be able to breathe like a normal person. All you have to do is unscrew the cap like so and then inhale it up each nostril for around two seconds. You just feel this cool air hit the back of your brain and I swear that I'm cleared out instantly. And as somebody who deals with really bad allergies, like I would wake up every single morning with my nose so clogged that I could barely breathe. These have been an absolute game changer because I just sniff it once when I wake up in the morning and I'm good to go for the rest of the day. Really the only problem that I have with these is that since they went so viral on TikTok, they're always selling out. I did put a link to where you can get these right here on this video though. If you see an orange shopping cart in the bottom left corner, that means they're in stock right now. But I wouldn't count on them being available for much longer. So click that orange shopping cart and go get some before they sell out again.",
