    "transcript": "I literally just dropped my phone leaving work. Now there's cracks all over the screen, as you can see. But I need to make this video because you're getting f***ing scammed and you should know about it. Now I can't lie, I was gonna keep this a secret till the day I die, but I saw that it was affecting kids, so I feel like I kinda have to say something. But here's the biggest lie that your dentist has probably already told you: fluoride is good for your teeth. Fluoride is often advertised as anti-cavity, and don't get me wrong, it does have anti-cavity properties, but the cons to ingesting fluoride are far, far worse. There is fluoride in 99% of kids' toothpastes and kids have incredibly sensitive teeth. Overusing fluoride will not only cause discoloration but will also destroy the top layer of your teeth called the enamel. Do not allow that to happen to your kids' teeth anymore. The correct mineral that your kid and yourself should be implementing into your oral health routine is nano-hydroxyapatite. This amazing mineral not only remineralizes your teeth but also fills in and reverses old cavities, as well as helps you get that bright and shiny smile. I'm gonna show you the product that anybody in the dental field will swear by. It's called the Underbrush remineralizing chewing gum. This is what it looks like right here, but what I love about it so much and the reason it's gonna save you so much money and skip all those expensive trips to the dentist is the fact that it also has minerals like xylitol. If you don't know what xylitol is, it's also an amazing remineralizer of the enamel, as well as it helps fight bacteria on your gums, which ultimately helps reverse old cavities or prevent new ones. All you gotta do is pop one in and chew it for 15 minutes a day, just like this, and you're good. Only problem is there's a ton of scammers copying the listing of the product and selling garbage from China. But I'm gonna leave the link right here to the original, authentic product from Nathan and Suns. And it's obviously US-made and sourced, as well as all organic ingredients. It does sell out super fast; it was literally sold out all of last month, but if you see an orange cart right here, that means that there's still some left, but I'd hurry up because it does not last.",

    "pacing_energy": "The video starts with a high-energy, attention-grabbing hook. The pacing remains relatively consistent throughout, with the speaker maintaining a moderately fast speech rate and enthusiastic tone.  The energy dips slightly during the sections showing research articles, but quickly recovers to promote the product."

  "core_lesson": "This video demonstrates that a controversial and attention-grabbing hook can drive significant views, but the lack of sales conversion highlights the importance of aligning the hook with a clear value proposition and a relevant audience."
