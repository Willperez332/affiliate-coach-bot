    "transcript": "Yo, shout out to the girl that I just took on a date because you're not gonna believe. You gonna be like, what the f***? So we went to this date at this Italian restaurant. And it's a nice little spot in the place where I stay. I stay in Indy. Obviously, I'm a gentleman. I had to go and pick her up, open the door for her, you know, chivalry. And the drive was about 20-30 minutes depending on how you drive. I'm a lead foot. You should know that. And we're talking, we're vibing, we get in the restaurant and everything is cool. But I noticed like she was, I don't know, sniffling. Like she sounded, you know how you can tell when somebody is congested or like starting to, like their voice is like kind of nasally. She pulls out this white little tube. And then she goes and inhales it just like, it's a normal thing. And I'm looking at her like, okay, I'll let it slide. But about 20 minutes go by, and I ask her, and I'm like, what, what are you doing? And she just kind of laughs because she didn't think anything of it. It was like muscle memory for her because I guess she has, she told me that she has allergies like crazy during the springtime. And I said, okay, valid, but what is that because I'm confused? And she told me it was a, it was a nasal stick. It's called Boom Boom. I laughed at the damn name of it because I was like, who comes up with this s***? So I asked her if I could use it or if she had a different one because I don't like to share nostril stuff or anything like that. Why, why do that? You got to be sanitary. Like, come on, people. But when I tell you, I, I'm addicted to the feeling that this gives me whenever I go and I inhale it because... You see how it cleared it up just that quick? But like, I'm addicted to the feeling of it, like feeling like an ice cube going right up to my brain and giving me like a bunch of energy. It's like the best thing in the world. You wouldn't believe her reason for getting it because I relate to it all too much. She said that she wakes up every spring with a clogged nostril on one side of her face every single night, to the point where she can't even sleep. So this was the only thing that was able to fix it for her. And I was looking at it, I was researching, obviously, I got to see if the reviews are good. It only has two f***ing uh, ingredients: essential oils and menthol. That's it. She told me where to go get more, but they've been sold out for the past month or so. So she was like, keep checking to see if the orange cart is right here at the bottom, and if it is, that means they're in stock, but if not, they're, they gone.",

  "core_lesson": "This video demonstrates that a compelling, slightly unusual story, presented with high energy and conversational style, can achieve massive views even without directly promoting a product or service. The lack of sales indicates that viewership alone doesn't guarantee revenue; a clear call to action and relevant product are crucial for conversion."
