    "transcript": "my mom's been a general practitioner for the past 25 years and she said this is the craziest case of sinuses she's ever seen. so this guy comes in with the worst chronic allergies I'm talking splitting headaches he couldn't breathe couldn't sleep constant congestion his nose was completely blocked off poor guy had already spent thousands on medications and treatments that just didn't work and my mom being honest with him told him hey the best we can do is more antihistamines and steroid sprays which he had already tried but four weeks later he comes back his sinuses completely 100% clear no more brain fog he was sleeping better going to work no headaches no allergies it was like a complete transformation and my mom told me that she asked him what he did because she's never seen anything like it and this guy says something completely crazy his sinus issues were not just allergies they were actually mold and fungus inside his body. so he went down this deep rabbit hole of research and he found out that one of the strongest antifungals in the planet is something we've been using for centuries oregano and not just any oregano oil of oregano this stuff has an active compound called carvacrol which has been clinically studied for its very potent antimicrobial antifungal anti mold and basically anti everything properties it doesn't just mask the symptoms it actually treats the problem from the root. I had to try it because my nose is always clogged up at night making it hard for me to sleep. I took two of these pearls and in 10 minutes it was like my nose was completely cleared I had the best sleep I was not expecting this to work that fast and after taking it for a couple weeks my itchy scalp gone not to mention I work at an airport and all of my co workers have gotten sick these past couple of weeks and I have been straight now the only downside about this stuff is that I had to wait a really long time to get it because it was sold out for the longest time but they actually just restocked so if you see that orange cart right there that means they're still in stock and that discount is still available but don't wait because once they're gone they take a long time to come back.",
