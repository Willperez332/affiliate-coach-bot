    "transcript": "if I hear one more doctor chalk up my symptoms to just getting old, I'm going to have an aneurysm. oh your hair is breaking off? oh you're just getting old. you're getting sick really easily no matter what, yeah that means your immune systems getting weaker and you're getting old. you're getting really dizzy, yeah you probably just stood up too fast and you're getting old. you're noticing dark circles under your eyes, yeah just take a nap you're getting old. Do you know it took one doctor to tell me and it wasn't even my primary. hey we're a bit concerned about your gut health we noticed a bit of bad bacteria in there like H pylori. are you feeling alright? that's probably why you feel all these symptoms and that's all it took a little bit of concern. so I went down this deep rabbit hole of research trying to find something better because they were already trying to get me on antibiotics and I'd be damned because those things mess me up and here's what I found. the most potent antibacterial, antimicrobial, antiviral, antifungal is something we've been using for centuries and we probably all have in our cabinets. oregano. but not just any oregano is oil of oregano and it looks like this. this is how you wanna take it if you want it to help you systematically for your gut health skin issues things like that. and let me tell you I've been taking this for over a month now and I felt a difference within days like my skin has never felt better. I was noticing some adult acne all that's gone my energy levels I'm waking up without any grogginess my bloating after heavy meals is done. the craziest one I was coming down with something the other day I'm talking runny nose scratchy throat upset stomach took two of these and within the day I was feeling great. one that I take looks like this. it's by micro ingredients all their supplements are really high quality. but my favorite part is that it has black seed oil which makes it even more potent and they're one of the only brands with the ultra high carvacrol content. I recommend every household have this in their medicine cabinet because you never know when you need it and it's one of the only remedies I've tried that actually works. so if you're interested I'm going to link it right here because they're running a huge flash sale right now. so trust me do something good for your health you are not gonna regret it.",
