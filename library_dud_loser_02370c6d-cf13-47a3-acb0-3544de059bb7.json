    "transcript": "You guys see that video of the girl crying because she started chewing remineralizing chewing gum and all her cavities started just disappearing? She said these gums saved her hundreds if not thousands of dollars in future dentist work. Well there was this huge debate going on in her comments whether this stuff actually works or not and I'm not gonna lie, I was the first one to call bullshit because I'm in the dental field and I've never heard of anything like this. But then I looked at the reviews and I noticed that there's over 60,000 fucking units sold and most of them are five stars. So I was like, fuck it. It's pretty inexpensive. I'll try it out. Let's see what happens. I have it right here. I've been chewing it for over three weeks now and holy shit, the results speak for themselves. Not only is my teeth sensitivity completely down, but even my girlfriend mentioned how much fresher my breath smells. I haven't got a hair of a fucking pack because holy shit in the morning, somethings are running in there. But that's not even the best part. I have a horrible sweet tooth and so I've had cavities throughout my entire life and when I tell you they literally begin to reverse. Now I was the biggest skeptic but when I actually looked into what this stuff has, I mean let me just read some of this stuff for you. It has organic xylitol, which if you don't know what that is, it literally helps target broken down enamel to reverse old cavities or help prevent new ones. But my favorite one by far is nano-hydroxyapatite which not only remineralizes your teeth, but it also helps rebuild early stage cavities which was my biggest issue. And it doesn't end there, it also has chicle, mastic, spruce, all super super super high quality natural ingredients that help clean your gums as well as remove all the tartar and plaque buildup. Plus it's sugar free and fluoride free. Now it definitely looks a little weird, it's like this little brown box, but all you gotta do is chew this for 15 minutes a day and you're good to go, which is exactly why it's game kept because you literally save yourself expensive trips to the dentist. Now the one negative thing I will have to say about this product is the fact that it's constantly sold out. I mean it's literally impossible to get your hands on it. Thank god they just restocked, but it does not last so I'm gonna leave the link right here. If you can see an orange cart, that means that it's not sold out yet, but I would run.",
