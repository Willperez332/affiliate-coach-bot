    "transcript": "Just because he's funny doesn't mean he's fucking joking. Listen to this. Are you a snorer? Do you snore? I do. I have a CPAP machine. Dude, so do I. Come on. CPAP team unite. CPAP! Because if I lay down flat I might die, I don't know. I wake up with horrible headaches and nightmares. And the driest mouth. Wake up before you die nightmare. Now focus, like isn't this the same exact thing that Shaq has been telling us for years and no one's paid attention. Listen. No, for the fact that I stopped breathing about 72 times per hour. It was very serious. And every now and then I wake up like... Did you ever try the CPAP? Yes, I did. And what was your experience there? Even though I'm tired when I put it on it'll take me another hour to get to sleep. So I'm just like, oh I don't like this. Now he goes on to talk about how he struggled for years with mouth breathing and chronic snoring. It was all due to a blocked nasal passageway. And that led to him getting a massive gut and dealing with all sorts of chronic health issues. Then he said that something, a natural remedy is what helped him. And his best friend, Charles Barkley was a shark on an episode of Shark Tank that got banned. And I swear that's the product he put them on that helped him with all these issues. Listen here. There's a base of menthol and peppermint in all of them. That's really good. It enhances your breathing. It'll just open you up. That's no coincidence. What they were trying were BoomBooms. They have a patented blend of menthol and essential oils that seriously work miracles. All you do is take a hit in each nostril. And instantly your nostrils are completely cleared. I've suffered from allergies and sleep apnea for years. This has been the only thing that has helped me and I think I'm hooked for life and I'm happy about it. If you or someone you love has some sort of nasal issue you're doing a disservice by ignoring this shit. And you gotta try it. The only problem is is now that they've been on Shark Tank they're crazy popular and they sell out all the time. So if you see the link down here that means they're still available and you have to get them as soon as you possibly can.",

  "core_lesson": "This video demonstrates that leveraging celebrity endorsements and a compelling narrative, even with a somewhat shocking hook, can drive exceptionally high viewership on platforms like TikTok.  However,  a high view count doesn't automatically translate into sales, particularly without a direct call to action or readily available product."
