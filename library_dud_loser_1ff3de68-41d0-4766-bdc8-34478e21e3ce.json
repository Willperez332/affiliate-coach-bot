    "transcript": "My cousin just recently got married and hired a $25,000 makeup artist and that does not even include her travel, her amenities, her food. You have to pay for her literally everything. It was absurd. Jen was so worried about looking old in her photos, so she was like, I'll pay any amount. I was like, okay girl. It was a bridesmaid and it was a mess in the room. Curling irons everywhere. Someone set off the smoke alarm. Pickle juice was spilled. Like, it was crazy. Makeup artist that she hired didn't really talk very much. She was kind of calm, collected. She was probably like so used to like such chaos everywhere. She was making everyone put this like one specific clear gloss on and I was like, okay. Between sips of mimosas, I finally got the courage and I asked her, I was like, what is this that you're forcing everyone to put on? Apparently it's her secret weapon at every single wedding and she makes all her clients do it and it's this here, Big City Beauty Lips.  I work on set for movies and that's where she first found it. It uses hyaluronic acid, oligo peptides and it's a treatment not just for now, but for later and it makes you look like you have filler. A couple minutes after she forced me to apply it, I literally looked at my lips and I was like, there is no way they just transform that much. But the bridesmaids, since we're younger, it makes our lips look way more full and plump and my aunt was going crazy cuz she was like this makes my fine lines literally go away. This lasted the whole entire night. Like I'm not kidding, it lasted through champagne, dancing, kisses, literally everything. Obviously, I went and ordered my own tube and look at this transformation. I just applied it. We're gonna wait like two minutes and let the magic work. Okay, a moment for the lips. I love it. It literally looks like I have filler. There's no stinging, it doesn't hurt and it's not like chemically. A big event coming up or you want your lips to like look better over time, I highly recommend the Big City Beauty Lip plumper. No pressure, but when a celebrity makeup artist uses this on all her clients, I think it's worth checking out.",
