    "transcript": "Kris Jenner revealed her new face looking incredible in her 70s. Then you have women like this praising the shot live on Jimmy Kimmel. Just watch this. What do you think about all the Ozempic and that stuff? Oh, I love it! I love, I like, do it! Do it. I have no judgment. If you want to do Ozempic, hell yeah, girl! Like, I'm not, I want people to feel more comfortable talking about doing it because I feel like there's like the shame, and the shame is only from thin people who want you to stay fat. And suddenly all these thin white women are like, diabetics need their meds. It's like, no, I think you're upset that Kathy Bates has a thigh gap. Like I can imagine, maybe she's coming for you! But then there was this viral nurse on here who convinced millions of women to take this stuff instead to get snatched. Personally I'm not waking up at 5 AM in the morning to go to the goddamn gym, but I will stand next to any gym girl and not give a f*** because I took digestive enzymes. I would recommend the bundle, but the digestive enzymes are where it's at because what people don't realize is that their gut is full of s*** that's rotting or turning into fat cells, one of the two. When you eat something and you don't digest it, it's rotting in your guts and it's going to either make you sick or it's going to turn into fat. That's just how it works. Google it. These digestive enzymes are what made the difference in getting my tummy on fleek. Period. She's not playing. This combo really did get me together. I went from looking like this to this in a little over a month. I'm down 12. My skin's actually cleared up a lot too since I'm properly flushing toxins all from healing my gut. The probiotics repopulate the gut with good bacteria while the enzymes actually break down all your food, good and bad, so you can absorb those nutrients and eliminate the rest. These together reduce inflammation and bloating, improve your metabolism, and reduce cravings so you can actually see some progress with your body goals. Really improve your health overall: your sleep, energy, mental health, digestion, skin, confidence, all that. Seriously, working on your gut health completely changes the way you feel in your body. So if you tried everything but working on your gut health, these seriously did work for me, but just make sure you get the official Physician's Choice brand. There's a lot of copycats on here, but they have literally thousands of results that you can look through. The deals for them are just better here on TikTok than I've seen in the store, so they do sell out kind of quickly. I had to wait like a month for these to be back in stock. If you still see the orange cart around here, grab them while you can.",

The pace then slows slightly as the creator explains their perspective and shows the relevant video clip.  The energy picks up when the creator transitions to their personal story and product demonstration, maintaining a relatively high energy level for the remainder of the video, with a call to action at the end."
  },
  "core_lesson": "This video demonstrates that leveraging a high-interest, somewhat controversial topic (celebrity cosmetic procedures and weight-loss drugs) can drive significant views, but the success of product placement depends on a relatable, authentic personal testimonial to convert a portion of that audience into customers."
