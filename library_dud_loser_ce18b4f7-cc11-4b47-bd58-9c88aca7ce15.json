    "transcript": "People come on Jimmy Kimmel and either say something spot on or the wildest shit I've ever heard. Just listen to this. What do you think about all the\u2026 oh I love it! I love, I'm like, do it! Do it! I have no judgment. If you wanna do it, some\u2026 hell yeah girl! Like I'm not\u2026 I want people to feel more comfortable talking about doing it cause I feel like there's like the shame. And the shame is only from thin people who want you to stay fat. It's suddenly all these thin white women are like, diabetics need their meds. It's like, no, I think you're upset that Kathy Bates has a thigh gap. Like, I think that's maybe\u2026 that's maybe\u2026 coming for you! But then there was this viral nurse on here who convinced millions of women to take this stuff instead to get snatched. I personally am not waking up at 5 am in the morning to go to the goddamn gym, but I will stand next to any gym girly and not give a f*** because I take digestive enzymes. I would recommend the bundle, but the digestive enzymes are where it's at because what people don't realize is that their gut is full of shit that's rotting or turning into fat cells, one of the two. When you eat something and you don't digest it, it's rotting in your guts and it's gonna either make you sick or it's gonna turn into fat. That's just how it works. Google it. These digestive enzymes are what made the difference in getting my tummy on flat flat. Period! And she's not playing. This combo really did get me together. I went from looking like this to this in a little over a month. I'm down 12 and my skin's cleared up so much since I'm properly flushing toxins, all from healing my gut. The probiotics repopulate the gut with good bacteria while the enzymes actually break down all your food, good and bad, so you can absorb those nutrients and eliminate the rest. These together reduce inflammation and bloating, improve your metabolism and reduce cravings so you can actually see some progress with your body goals. Really improve your health overall: your sleep, energy, mental health, digestion, skin, confidence, all that. Seriously, working on your gut health completely changes the way you feel in your body. If you've tried everything but getting your gut health in check, these really did work for me. Just make sure you get the official Physician's Choice brand. There's a lot of copycats on here, but they have thousands of great reviews you can look through. The deals for them are just better on TikTok than I've seen anywhere in the store, so they do sell out kind of quickly. I had to wait like a month for these to be back in stock. If you still see that orange cart around there, grab these while you can.",
