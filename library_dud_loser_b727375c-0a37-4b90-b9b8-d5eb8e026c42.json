    "transcript": "I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but Kendrick's halftime performance was a direct message to the people in power and the fucked up systems we have in this country. But the mainstream media loves to leave clues in plain sight. Just look at what this vintage cartoon exposed just a couple of years ago. You've discovered the holy grail of modern medicine. Why the hell would you keep it buried like this? I'll tell you why. Because there's far more money to be made in treating a disease than in curing it. Why cure someone in a day if we can treat them for a lifetime and bill them every step along the way? What you're doing here is criminal, and I'm going to tell the whole world about it. Is that right? Who's gonna believe you? The internet? You'll be just another nutjob left-wing blogger. And if you think that's crazy, just listen to what this doctor was trying to warn us about before he got silenced. If you figure out a way to help patients heal and that way doesn't include a pill or a surgery, then the hospital and the doctor are in big trouble because if you figure out a way to help people heal and you can't charge them for it, well then you've just worked yourself out of a job. So basically, if there's something out there that can help you, but they can't make money on it, then there's no incentive for them to tell you about it. And this is where things get interesting because they tried to censor this doctor's page for talking about a natural way to deal with something that a lot of us deal with as we age. Just listen. I was taking this vitamin, I never took it before, go to sleep, wake up and I just noticed like all this stiffness that I would normally have because of all the injuries to my spine. It's like someone put WD-40 in my joints. I'm like, why am I feeling so loose? So I'm like, oh, I took that vitamin day before. Specifically in the mitochondria. And it's a precursor to this molecule called NAD. And NAD is involved in over 400 different genes, so it's a really important molecule. Now I did some research and not only does increasing your NAD help with things like weak and fragile joints, it can also be helpful for things like deep lines and wrinkles, mental delays and cloudiness, fatigue and even with that extra baggage we put on, it seems impossible to get rid of. Now there's two ways to raise your NAD. You can either get an IV, which is extremely expensive, or you could do what I do, which is take something called nicotinamide riboside. But whatever you do, do not get some random bottle of NR. Make sure you get one that contains liposomal and resveratrol because this is what boosts that NAD on a cellular level. Personally, this is the one I've been taking from Reus Research. Not only did they have like 400,000 orders, but they had a bunch of five-star reviews that y'all can check out for yourselves. I've only been taking this for a few months, but in that time, my left knee, which has had constant issues over the years to the point where it would be aching almost every single morning, has not felt this good in a very long time. The only problem I have is ever since these two girls started talking about this, they have been selling out extremely fast. If you're still seeing an orange cart and you want to try this for yourself, I would grab a bottle while you can.",

    "pacing_energy": "The video maintains a relatively fast pace throughout, with quick cuts between the presenter's segments and the video clips. The energy level is high, driven by the dramatic music and the presenter's enthusiastic delivery.  The use of shocking and controversial statements keeps viewers engaged. However, this pace may make it difficult for some viewers to fully process the information presented."

  "core_lesson": "This video demonstrates that while a sensationalized and controversial hook can generate views, a lack of clear call-to-action and effective product integration leads to low sales, even with established brand credibility and positive customer reviews."
