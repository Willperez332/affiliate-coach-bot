    "transcript": "I'm gonna get a lot of hate for saying this, but Black people are some of the weirdest people on the planet cuz how do we always know like a secret remedy for everything? Let me explain. So a couple weeks ago I was down bad sick, like could not leave the bed. I'm talking body aches, nose stuffed up and running at the same time. However that works. Had a really bad cough, sore throat the whole night. I started feeling a little bit better a few days ago so I'm like, okay, let me go to the gym and sweat this last little bit out on the treadmill. Y'all, I was on this treadmill looking like death three minutes into the workout. And this older Black woman who's always there, she looks amazing and in such great shape, she's basically like my dream mom. So she comes up to me like, oh, baby, you've been sick, haven't you? I can tell cuz I hadn't been there in a couple of weeks. So I'm like, yeah, I'm getting better but I do still have like a little cough, a lot of mucus and no appetite or energy. She looks at me like I'm crazy and just walks away. I'm like, damn, I'm not contagious anymore. But she comes back with this little bag and was like, all you need is oil of oregano and you'll feel good by tomorrow. I don't even know what this is, so she starts going on and on about it and I'm a little bit skeptical cuz I've been taking meds from CVS and they weren't doing anything. But at this point I'm like, whatever, I'll try anything. So I took it that day and I didn't really feel much at first. I'm like, all right, wasting my time. But a few hours later I started coughing up so much mucus that was like stuck, it was disgusting. And when I woke up the next day I felt nothing like I did the day before. I felt good, like actually great. There was no more coughing, no stuffy nose, my energy was better and I had a really big breakfast that day cuz my appetite actually came back. I was not expecting this little random baggie of medicine to work that good. So I looked it up on TikTok and I'm seeing videos with millions of views with people swearing by this stuff for everything from flus to allergies to yeast infections. Apparently because oil of oregano is naturally antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, basically anti-everything. So I had to get the full bag and I'm telling you, this is one of those things they don't want us knowing about because if everybody started using this at the first sign of sickness, big pharma and healthcare would be losing money. This brand, Micro Ingredients, is apparently one of the best ones, so I highly suggest you just check out the reviews, you'll see exactly what I mean. So if you're prone to allergies, seasonal illnesses, infections for the ladies, or you just want something more natural in the medicine cabinet, this shit is the truth. I'm gonna link it at the cart here. If it's not there, that means they're sold out.",
