    "transcript": "I will bet you half a ham sandwich that all of the girls on that runway got lymphatic drainage before they went on that stage. One of my hottie pants best friends used to do swimsuit modeling back in the day, and they always made her do lymphatic drainage before a big show. I wasn't seeing any armpit rolls, I wasn't seeing any deep cellulite, I wasn't seeing any puffy eyelids, and their freaking energy was next level. You don't look like that in a swimsuit if you have lymphatic congestion. If you want to get rid of lymphatic congestion quick, you can do dry brushing, you can do lymphatic drainage massage, or you can just do what all these supermodels are doing and get these lymphatic support drops. These little drops have all natural organic ingredients to help reduce inflammation, get that lymphatic fluid flowing and draining. So all that puffiness in places that you don't want puffiness, gone. I take these like seven days before an event, a vacation, and it has me looking and feeling better quick. Like this has my pits looking snatched in a swimsuit. If you know you know, Mary Ruth's makes the best supplements, but I feel like this one is really slept on. Really one of their best blends because supporting lymphatic health is going to help your whole body feel better, not just your pits. Go ahead and check these out while they're still on sale because after you use them, I swear you're gonna have like runway level confidence.",
