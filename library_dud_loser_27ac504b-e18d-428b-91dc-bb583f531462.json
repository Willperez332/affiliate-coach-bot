    "transcript": "Mandela effect is fucking insane. You're telling me the Monopoly man never had a monocle? Fruit Loops was spelled with two O's and now nobody seems to remember when the Bee Movie exposed how corrupt our society is. Billion dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Is this what nature intended for us? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man! They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients who all run perfectly legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case. Mr. Flamin', I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. Now if that wasn't enough when this whistleblower went on a podcast to try and tell the whole world about this, it was completely taken down. This is what they're hiding...Kennedy conducted hearings in 1970 about agency captured FDA. At that time the conclusion of that hearing is that the FDA was no longer serving the public interest. It was more public health. It ceased being a public health agency. It was now an agency whose primary focus was maximizing corporate profit taking. And if you don't think he's telling the truth, then tell me why when this doctor tried to tell us about a natural remedy that they have hidden from us for years, his entire YouTube was banned. I'm going to talk about 14 amazing benefits of oregano oil. Antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic, anti yeast, anti candida. Oregano oil is a very powerful antioxidant. It's good for acne, very beneficial for allergies. Oregano oil is good for bad breath, colds, the flu, sinus issues. Now I've been taking these for the last couple months and I can see why people would want to keep these hidden. Like last week I had a really bad sore throat, so before I went to bed I just took two of these capsules and when I woke up that sore throat was completely gone. Now I do like to use the one from MicroIngredients just because it is all natural. It is only the oil of oregano plus they have hundreds of five star reviews. But I will say because of all those five star reviews they're almost always sold out on TikTok. Now if you do want to try this for yourself I can try and leave a link on the bottom of this video but it does only pop up if they have stock left and the last time I checked they only had a couple hundred bags left. So if you do see that orange box right here I would not wait around.",

    "pacing_energy": "The video maintains a consistently high energy level throughout. The presenter speaks rapidly and enthusiastically, using emphatic hand gestures.  The pacing is brisk, with quick cuts between the presenter and screen-captured content. This creates a sense of urgency and intrigue."

  "core_lesson": "This video demonstrates that while a high-energy, conspiratorial style can garner a moderate number of views,  a lack of clear call to action and product scarcity severely limits sales conversion."
