    "transcript": "This mother and daughter just cracked the code to the fountain of youth. I want you to look at this photo right here. One of them is 20 years old and one of them is 42. Can you guess which one is which? Well, if you guessed her, then you're right. This mama has been going viral for aging like fine wine and she talks about how she gets this youthful complexion on the Kelly Clarkson show. I mean, on behalf of every woman watching right now, where is the fountain? Like, did you find it of youth? Like, did you find it or are you hiding it? Like, what do you do? Always lived a pretty healthy lifestyle and taking care of myself. Um, I very rarely ever drink alcohol and I don't smoke. As far as my skin goes, I've always been acne-prone and so since I was about 12 or 13, I was always messing around with my mom's skincare because I do feel like it's helped with um my lines and hyperpigmentation and just like the glow of my skin. Now that I think of it, I've seen this exact video of Jennifer Lopez a few days ago talking about the exact same thing. Okay, I just took off the mask, honestly. I cannot even see a line on my face in 10 years. I feel like it took 10 years off my face. I needed to know the moisturizers that they've been using, so I dug even deeper and came across this video of her ex-boyfriend talking about it. You use beef tallow? I do use beef tallow. As a moisturizer? Yeah. How the hell did you know that? A favor, right? If you're watching this or if you're just listening in the room, tonight or tomorrow morning, whenever you put your moisturizer on, if you don't put moisturizer on, I don't know, you may you may want to think about that depends how old you are, but like go look at your moisturizer, right? It it probably has like 50 ingredients and you might know like what two of them are, right? Beef tallow is just beef tallow. It's just beef fat. And since this all-natural skincare doesn't contain all these toxic chemicals like these major skincare brands, is the reason why no one wants us knowing about it. Now, someone explained to me why my face used to break out so bad when using a product recommended to me by my dermatologist, but then once I switched over to just this beef tallow and water, my skin is clear and glowing because this is filled with antioxidants and vitamins that help repair my skin barrier. It doesn't have those toxic ingredients to harm me. So if you're someone that actually wants to take care of their skin and age like fine wine and not pump it with a bunch of toxic chemicals, please try the all-natural route while this video is still up. I'll be leaving a link to this specific special ingredient down below in the orange cart, but if I were you, I would act fast and grab one quick.",
