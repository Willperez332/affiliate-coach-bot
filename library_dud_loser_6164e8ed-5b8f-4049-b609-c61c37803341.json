    "transcript": "This man was confirmed 24 hours ago and he's already coming after one of the most corrupt industries on the planet. Just watch this. There is nothing more profitable in our society today than a sick child. Because it... all of these entities are making money on him; insurance companies, the hospitals, the medical cartel, the pharmaceutical companies have lifetime annuities. And they're literally, that kid is sick -- they don't want to kill them. They want them sick for the rest of their lives. Now you tell me, but is that not exactly what his buddy Donald White was talking about just a couple of months ago. I will never go to a doctor ever again about my general health. Um, they have no clue what they're talking about and all they wanna do is put you on pills. The medicines are just gonna start to stack up and before you know it, you're gonna be on 14 pills with ten different side effects from each one of them. Now this is where things get weird because around that same time they were trying to censor this doctor for talking about a natural way to slow down the aging process. Listen carefully. If you could take a pill that could delay the way you age or make you live, you know, longer or better. Have you heard of like nicotinamide riboside? There's been all these studies and they're finding that, you know, for example, if you feed them nicotinamide riboside it delays aging in their liver, in their bones, in their um eyes, their muscle, their tissues are aging better. They they have enhanced endurance, they have a better mitochondrial function. So I did my own research on this and basically nicotinamide riboside converts into one of the most important molecules in our body called NAD. But unfortunately in our mid-twenties our NAD levels begin to plummet. And these low NAD levels is exactly what leads to things like those accelerated signs of aging like those deep lines and wrinkles, those weak and fragile joints, mental delays and cloudiness, that dreaded fatigue where you don't want to do anything and even that extra sagginess that you can never seem to get rid of. But like she said by supplementing with nicotinamide riboside not only can you bring those NAD levels back up to where they were when you were in your early twenties, but it can help with all of these things, right here. Personally, this is the one I've been taking from Reus Research. Not only did they have almost 400,000 orders but they had thousands and thousands of five-star reviews that you can check out for yourself. I've been taking these for about four months now and I feel like not only are these lines starting to dim down a bit, but my wrist which has had constant issues over the years, to the point where almost every single morning it would be aching, has not felt this loose in a very, very long time. The only bad thing I will say is they have been selling out extremely fast lately. So if you do want to try this for yourself, I'm gonna link it down below in the orange cart.",
