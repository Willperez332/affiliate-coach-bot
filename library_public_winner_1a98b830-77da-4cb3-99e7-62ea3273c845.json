    "transcript": "Here's some almond daughter traumas I endured growing up. First off, everything was a health lesson. Gum, for example, was not allowed while my friends were popping Trident. I was over here chewing fennel seeds because apparently they freshen up your breath, get rid of bloating. I'm always passionate about the fact that gum is really bad for you and has really bad additives and added sugar and the list goes on and on. She also claims that artificial sweeteners cause brain fog and dementia. Yep, you heard that right. Apparently, there are studies that prove this. I actually really do try to stay away from artificial sweeteners and sugars because if it's not natural, why are we putting it into our bodies? I've been a bloated IBS girly since literally third grade. My mom's number one hack, take a wild guess. Apple cider vinegar for literally everything: bloating, cramps while I'm on my period, hormonal acne, cystic acne. It was her holy grail for literally everything. Every day before school, my mom had us taking two shots of apple cider vinegar, and to me, it was almost like a form of punishment in all honesty. Recently, my brother and I came across apple cider vinegar gummies, and our lives were changed. I feel like a lot of people are not talking about the fact that apple cider vinegar actually ruins your enamel and burns your intestinal lining. That is not good for you. That's why I switched over to the apple cider vinegar gummies because first off, they taste better. It does not feel like a form of punishment, and I'm getting the same exact effects. Minus all the trauma. No more bloating, no more cravings. Apple cider vinegar is anti-inflammatory, so my skin looks absurd, way better than it was. My hormonal acne used to be so bad and it's so much better honestly. It's kinda scary how good it works. I just wanted to come on here and let everyone know that we are in 2025 working smarter, not harder. We do not need to be pouring liquid acid down our throat anymore when we could literally be having a really tasty gummy that gives you all the same exact effects. It heals your gut microbiome, it heals your acne, it heals your hormonal acne, it heals your cystic acne. It gives you energy. It will have you looking and feeling like the best version of yourself. You can get it literally anywhere and everywhere, but I feel like they always mark it up at the store for some reason, which is kinda annoying. So I get mine off TikTok shop because it's so much cheaper. They're always running flash sales and deals. Highly recommend. You're welcome.",

    "pacing_energy": "The video maintains a consistent, relatively fast pacing throughout. The energy is high, driven by the engaging storytelling and the speaker's enthusiastic delivery.  The repetitive action of peeling the zucchini provides a visual rhythm that complements the fast-paced narration."

  "core_lesson": "This video demonstrates that a relatable, personal story combined with product promotion can achieve high viewership; however,  a lack of direct sales integration within the video limits the conversion potential despite significant views."
