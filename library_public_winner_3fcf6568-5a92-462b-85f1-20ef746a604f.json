    "transcript": "These two random dudes right here are the reason why most people don't trust hospitals. Watch this next clip very carefully. If you figure out a way to help patients heal and that way doesn't include a pill or a surgery, then the hospital and the doctor are in big trouble. If you figure out a way to help people heal and you can't charge them for it, then you've just worked yourself out of a job. It can't be a coincidence that this random man right here went on the Rogan podcast and said this. Like oil of oregano, like using oil of oregano instead of using um\u2026 antibiotics. And have you felt an effect? Yes. Yeah? What do you feel when you\u2026 Well, I used to have really thick dark circles under my eyes. That's gone away in the last six months I've been using that. My skin\u2026 I'm 55 years old. I'm 55 years old and I smoke. Do I look like I'm 55 years old? Don't\u2026 you look great. And do you think that's because of this? I think\u2026 well\u2026 I'm gonna show you a picture of what I used to look like. Imagine if more people knew about this. What would happen to the hospitals? That's because oil of oregano is like anti-everything. And it's known as nature's antibiotic. Anytime someone in my household gets like an upset stomach, runny nose, scratchy throat, all that stuff and we take this oil of oregano specifically from micro ingredients, it literally knocks it right out. I can remember the last time someone in my family was like sick sick and wanted to take something else instead of this. And you can literally look it up. Oil of oregano has been around for centuries. They talk about it in all the old remedy books and how you can use it to even detox the body. The only problem is that not all oil of oregano is made the same. It needs to be one with a high carvacrol extract, specifically like this one, because that is like the main active ingredient. So if you're like sick of getting sick, I'm gonna leave the cheapest link to where I found it right here.",
