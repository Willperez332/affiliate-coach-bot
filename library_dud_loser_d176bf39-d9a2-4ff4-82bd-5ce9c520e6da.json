    "transcript": "TikTok is spiraling over Roman Atwood's viral video. Watch this clip that sent TikTok into a frenzy the other day. One second. I wanna show something to you. This is my drink. Yeah, very cool man. And I think it's going to disrupt the entire energy drink world. It is fueled by the same ketones your body produces when you're fasting and when you're in ketosis. I want you to try this, but also I'm happy to supply your whole campaign with it. Ketones are sour, so it has a kick. It's good stuff, man. I like it. It will make you rich. Not being dramatic when I say that these drinks literally changed my life. I have an autoimmune called POTS, so I'm constantly lethargic and cannot have caffeine of any sort, literally ever. So I thought that I was doomed for the rest of my life. My brain fog is gone. I'm hitting extra reps at the gym. I'm waking up before my alarm. I'm doing eight hours of work within two hours. I went from I'll start it tomorrow energy to it's getting done today energy. Roman said in his video, this is made with ketones, an energy source that already is naturally occurring in our bodies. So it's good for you. It's healthy, and look how clean these ingredients are. These are aunt and daughter approved. I'm also not here to try to make you give up your coffee. All I'm saying is that if you are tired of getting that anxious, jittery feeling, maybe switch this out for like your fourth cup or something. Roman knew what he was doing when he was making these. I'm locked in. I'm getting my work done, and I actually feel like I can live life now without being a zombie every single day. So thanks, Roman. You changed my life, and I'm not being dramatic.",
