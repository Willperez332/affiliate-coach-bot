    "transcript": "Another Hollywood legend gone, but why the fuck is no one talking about the real reason she had so much work done? Turns out her Swiss billionaire husband had this strange obsession with her staying so youthful, but this is where things get weird. No one remember when Sandra Bullock slipped up on an interview a couple years back exposing what's really been going on through the skin and ruptures of collagen and then boost it you look like a burn victim for a day but then it's but then it pushes. What are you pushing into the skin? So you push in whatever the facialist would like to insert into your pores. But what is it? It is an extraction from a um a um a piece of skin uh that came from a young person um far far away and they somehow figured out how to extract this foreskin from a Korean baby. He mentions how she had to use skin from a younger person to stay youthful. It's not even the worst part, even the celebrity doctor came out and had something to say. Are you sitting down for this grass fed tallow? That's actually beef fat. Might sound disgusting, but the chemistry of tallow is very similar to the chemistry of part of your skin. In fact, the Latin word for tallow means sebum that is the oil your body produces that's like the oil that your body produces the skin oil tallow will not oxidize the skin it will not cause inflammation. It has vitamin A, D, E, K. Gives your skin a very nice softness a healthy glow and a lot of nutrients in this tallow can also help some of the dark spots as well in the skin and help wrinkles. Just try it for a week and just see what happens. He goes on to talk about the benefits of beef tallow and how it has all of these anti-aging benefits. How people have been using this stuff for thousands of years for things like fine lines, wrinkles, acne. I wanted to see if they were lying because this was me four months ago. Nothing was working for me. No creams, no serums, nothing. Switched to warm water and beef tallow and my skin has never looked this clear in my entire life. Even my hyperpigmentation, my eye bags, those are gone. The reason I think it works so well on me is because the beef tallow I use in particular has marigold pop flower extract, which is known for its anti-aging benefits. Even my mom started using things like this and her skin has never looked that good. Be careful about where you're getting your beef tallow from because so many people make the mistake of getting the cheap stuff and they wonder why it's not working. The one I use in particular is by this brand called Evil Goods because they use the highest quality beef tallow out there on the market. No toxins, no chemicals, and this is just all premium organic ingredients. That's a big reason why you hear no one talking about this or you guys make that jump and do something drastic and expensive. I highly recommend looking into something as natural as beef tallow. Do you guys a favor and link the one I use down below. Pretty sure they're like 50% off right now, so grab them while you can.",

    "pacing_energy": "The video starts with a high-energy, shocking introduction, then maintains a moderate pace to present the information clearly. The energy increases again during the reveal of the controversial interview and when the presenter shows his own before-and-after results. The pacing slows down for informative sections, then picks up again towards the end with the product recommendation."

  "core_lesson": "This video demonstrates that a high-view count, achieved through a controversial and shocking hook, does not automatically translate into sales; however, genuine personal testimonials and product information can effectively drive viewer engagement, despite a moderate view count."
