    "transcript": "I don't even fit into my jeans anymore and I only packed two pairs and I'm on a trip and it's literally all thanks to this Nature's Zempic drink that I was just posting about. Y'all, I haven't even been on this for a month yet and like the results. Like if this isn't the proof. I wouldn't have bought a pair of jeans that fit me like this. I quite literally have to eat before I drink this or I will not get hungry at all. I saw this video of a woman saying she was down four pants sizes because of this drink and I was like, there is no way. There's absolutely no way. I'm a holistic RN. I was super skeptical. What sold me you guys is I clicked on the product and I read the reviews and some of these before and afters were like the pants were like huge and this girl was like, I just had twins and I'm literally skinnier now than when I had babies. It was like crazy. All these amazing testimonials and I was like, I need to know the science behind why this works. So I ordered it. I got it in the mail. I got the one with like all the little packets and it's so convenient because it's not messy. You just get like a whole bunch of these little single servings. But if you prefer the powder, you can get that too. And I started drinking it and I also went this whole deep dive to figure out why these work. Guys, this is quite literally formulated to release GLP-1, which is the same thing that the Zempic...the shot that makes everyone go *pffft*. That's what this does. But natural. And Zempic is like known to cause the C-word, like infertility, bone density loss, all these really scary things are being now linked to that shot. It's just really scary and I was like determined to find something that could be that and I think this is it you guys because the results that I'm seeing are incredible. This truly stuns your appetite. But not only that, this has apple fiber which makes you feel more full than you really are. So you don't eat as much. You don't feel the need to stuff yourself. It has yerba mate which has been known since like ancient times to be a glowing skin, weight stature, like all these things that moms would drink to look very good. And this also has pre and probiotics that line your gut so when you do eat, you don't eat. And lining your gut with pre and probiotics every day. Amazing. Guys, they didn't need to do this, but they also have a natural caffeine. Like yerba has a natural caffeine. It has L-theanine and Lions Mane. So you get that like amazing energy. Like, I'll drink this mid-afternoon to like late morning and I'll just feel like incredible. It's better than coffee. I don't crash. I get like this focused energy. I'm just like cleaning and like able to go on a walk, do all these things. And I feel amazing. I don't crash and I'm stunting my hunger. Do you see this? Like my waistline where did it go? Yerba Magic is the freaking Nature's Zempic y'all and I'm telling you right now, this is this is the new it girl. Like we we need to get keep her she's amazing.",
