    "transcript": "Arm pits look like this or this? You're not fat, you just have lymphatic congestion. Do you know how many photos I've deleted over the years including some of my own wedding photos because I didn't like the way my armpits looked like little booblets. No matter how many arm and chest exercises I did at the gym, that little poof was still there. Honestly, thank God for my crunchy-ass mother-in-law because she has a holistic health hack for everything. This lady gets lymphatic drainage massages, okay? She told me the puffiness I was having in my face and in my pits was probably just extra lymphatic fluid just sitting there that needed to be drained. Listen, I can't afford to be getting lymphatic drainage massages every week, but she did hook me up with these organic lymphatic drops that have amazing ingredients to help lower inflammation and get like all that lymphatic fluid moving. So it's not just sitting there making you look and feel all puffy. Like this pit, I would never be wearing this tank top, but the amount of fluid and puffiness that has fallen off of my body since I started taking this is actually crazy. This is the one my mother-in-law swears by, and that lady knows her supplements. So this is the one I'll be sticking with. If you want to check it out, MaryRuth has it on sale right now. Literally go run and check these out while they're still in stock so you can start rocking that tank top with confidence.",
